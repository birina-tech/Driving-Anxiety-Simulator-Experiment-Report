# Driving-Anxiety-Simulator-Experiment-Report
This study investigates the impact of driving anxiety on young drivers’ behavioral, physiological, and subjective responses within immersive VR environments modeled after real-world traffic scenarios. 



Utilizing a high-fidelity driving simulator and rigorous experimental design, we compared the performance of anxiety (AG) and non-anxiety (NAG) groups (aged 18–25) across five complex and realistic driving scenarios. Key outcome measures included self-reported confidence, behavioral performance (mean speed, perception and response latencies), and physiological reactivity (heart rate and heart rate variability).
