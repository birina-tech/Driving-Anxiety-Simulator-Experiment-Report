<p>This study utilizes a driving simulator available at the
<strong>Transportation Research and Visualization Laboratory (TRAVL),
University at Buffalo,</strong> to investigate the behavior and
physiological responses of young drivers (aged 18-25) in complex driving
scenarios.</p>
<div id="study-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Study Objectives</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Examine how driving anxiety affects the behavioral of young drivers
across different critical driving scenarios;</li>
<li>Quantify the impact of anxiety on drivers’ physiological and
psychological states;</li>
<li>Explore whether affirmative feedback influences driver behavior,
psychological state (level of anxiety), and self-reported safety
perception during driving tasks.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="key-takeaways" class="section level2">
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<pre><code>The pre-defined anxiety_group from Phase 1 are correlated with some aspects of gaze behavior. The Non-Anxious (N) group consistently had higher saccade_count and fixation_count across almost all scenarios, suggesting a more active visual scanning pattern than the Anxious (A) group.

The positive affirmation (between car and car_t2 scenarios) caused the two groups&#39; gaze behavior to move in opposite directions. 
  (1) The Anxious group&#39;s focused AIO attention increased (car_t2_aoi_dur_percent: +5.9%), while the Non-Anxious group&#39;s focus remained stable (car_t2_aoi_dur_percent: +0.4%). 
  (2) After the affirmaiton the dwell time for Non-Anxious group decresed, while Anxious group demostrated increase. 

The anxiety_group from Phase 1 are correlated with most of the self-reported cognitive state metrics such as feeling streesed, confused, or safe. </code></pre>

<div id="experiment-set-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Experiment Set Up</h2>
<p>Four distinct experimental scenarios (two dynamic, two static) were
developed within an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVE).</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Scenario_map.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<div id="dynamic-scenario-12---sudden-vehicle-at-intersection"
class="section level3">
<h3>Dynamic Scenario 1&amp;2 - Sudden Vehicle at Intersection</h3>
<p>This scenario simulated an unexpected vehicle intrusion at an urban
intersection, modeled based on typical roadway configurations found in
urban areas of New York State, and includes intersection with pedestrian
crosswalks, signage, and stop lines. Participants navigated along a
primary urban route encountering three intersections where participant
has right of way. At the third intersection, a vehicle approached
rapidly from a minor side street, deliberately entering the intersection
without properly yielding at the stop sign. Participants were required
to quickly perceive the intrusion and react accordingly.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Car.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="dynamic-scenario-3---unexpected-pedestrian-crossing"
class="section level3">
<h3>Dynamic Scenario #3 - Unexpected Pedestrian Crossing</h3>
<p>In this scenario, drivers transitioned from a rural roadway into an
urbanized area, subsequently merging back into a rural environment. Upon
passing a clearly marked unsignalized pedestrian crossing, participant
encountered a pedestrian unexpectedly stepping onto the roadway which
drivers will not have direct sight distance to until they are very
close.</p>

</div>
<div id="static-scenario-4---garbage-truck-obstructing"
class="section level3">
<h3>Static Scenario #4 - Garbage Truck Obstructing</h3>
<p>This static scenario simulated a rural residential environment
involving restricted forward visibility caused by stationary garbage
truck. The truck model and positioning were chosen based on common
real-world garbage collection operations, verified through pilot testing
to ensure visibility obstruction.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Truck.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="static-scenario-5--utility-construction-zone"
class="section level3">
<h3>Static Scenario #5- Utility Construction Zone</h3>
<p>This static scenario involved navigating through a rural residential
environment partially blocked due to ongoing construction work. The
scene was carefully designed according to standard roadway construction
configurations outlined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MUTCD). The setup featured a manhole surrounded by clearly marked
construction barriers and signage.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Work_zone.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="approach-to-scenario-randomization" class="section level2">
<h2>Approach to scenario randomization</h2>
<p>Scenarios were presented in a partially randomized order to control
potential sequence effects and enhance experimental validity. Each
scenario lasted approximately 3 minutes. At the beginning of each
session, participants first completed two dynamic scenarios, either the
Sudden Vehicle Intrusion or the Unexpected Pedestrian Crossing scenario
was presented first, selected randomly to minimize order effects. This
was followed by one of the two static scenarios, either the Utility
Construction Zone or the Garbage Truck Obstruction, also selected in a
randomized order for each participant to balance potential sequence
biases.</p>
<p>After the initial exposure to two dynamic and one static scenario,
participants received standardized <strong>affirmative feedback</strong>
emphasizing positive aspects of their performance, intended to reinforce
confidence before the subsequent second run of the Sudden Vehicle
Intrusion (dynamic) scenario.</p>
<p>Finally, all participants completed a second static scenario (that
was not presented before), allowing for within-subject comparisons to
assess the impacts of positive affirmative on driving behaviors and
perceived driving anxiety.</p>
<p>Importantly, participants were not informed that they would repeat
the Sudden Vehicle Intrusion scenario, ensuring that their responses
during the second exposure reflected genuine reactions without
anticipation of bias.</p>

<p>A comparison of visual behavior before and after positive affirmation
in Car scenario for both Anxious (A) and Non-Anxious (N) groups.</p>
<div id="general-scanning-saccades-fixations" class="section level3">
<h3>General Scanning (Saccades &amp; Fixations):</h3>
<pre><code>Both the Anxious and Non-Anxious groups showed a decrease in their scanning behavior, with both Saccade Count and Fixation Count dropping in the second Car scenario after recieving positive affirmation.

The Anxious group&#39;s reduction in scanning was more pronounced. Their Saccade Count dropped by -24.3% (vs. -12.3% for the N-group).

The Anxious group&#39;s Revisit Count (how often they looked back at an AOI) fell by -30.8%, a much larger drop than the Non-Anxious group&#39;s -18.2% decrease.</code></pre>
<p><img src="Driving_Anxiety_Phase_II_html_files/figure-html/scanning-interaction-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="gaze-focus-duration-dwell-time" class="section level3">
<h3>Gaze Focus (Duration &amp; Dwell Time):</h3>
<pre><code>The most significant finding is a difference in AOI duration (in %). The Anxious group&#39;s AOI duration (percent of time looking at the main hazard) increased by +5.9%. The Non-Anxious group&#39;s focus remained almost unchanged, increasing by only +0.4%, demostrating negative interaction between groups and intervention (positive affirmation) warranting careful consideration in the future study. 

Despite the increased focus (AOI %), the total Dwell Time (total milliseconds spent on the AOI) decreased for both groups, as the Dwell Count (number of separate dwells) also dropped. Interection for this metric is also negative for both groups and intervention.

The combination of observations related to fewer saccades and more AOI duration suggests the affirmation may have induced a &quot;tunnel vision&quot; effect in the Anxious group, causing them to scan less and focus more narrowly on the primary AOI. However, results are not statistically significant and further exploration is needed with larger sample size.

The Anxious group, which already had a longer average Fixation Duration (longer gazes), demonstrated duration increase by +5.3% after the affirmation. In contrast, the Non-Anxious group&#39;s fixation duration decreased by -1.9%, </code></pre>

<div id="statistical-significance" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical Significance:</h3>
<pre><code>While these results demostrate some important trends, the t-test on the difference-in-differences (comparing the change in A-group vs. the change in N-group) did not show a statistically significant interaction for all metric (all p-values &gt; 0.05) but one. 

This &quot;lack of significance&quot; does not mean there was no effect. It means we cannot statistically prove that the affirmation&#39;s effect was different for the two groups. </code></pre>

<h3>Scenario-Specific Anxiety (1-9 Scale)</h3>
<div

class="section level4">
<h4>Major observations based on the statistical output from your code
for the ‘I Was Stressed’</h4>
<pre><code>Unlike some of the other metrics where the results were mixed, the agreement to the statment &quot;I felt stressed&quot; shows a very clear pattern. The Anxious group reported significantly higher percived stress (rated on a 1-9 scale) than the Non-Anxious group in 4 out of the 5 scenarios: Car (p=0.004), Car_T2 (p=0.006), Truck (p=0.003), and Work Zone (p=0.008).

There is a clear separation in the baseline stress ratings. The Anxious group&#39;s mean stress was always higher (lowest was 3.56). The Non-Anxious group&#39;s mean stress was consistently low (all 2.67 or below), except for the Pedestrian scenario (4.00).

The Pedestrian scenario was the only one where the stress ratings were statistically similar (p=0.145). It was also the only scenario where the Non-Anxious group&#39;s mean stress (4.00) was higher than their rating for any other scenario, suggesting this scenario was uniquely stressful for them in a way the others were not.</code></pre>

class="section level4">
<h4>Major observations based on the statistical output from your code
for the ‘I Was Confused’</h4>
<pre><code>The Anxious group reported significantly higher confusion ratings than the Non-Anxious group in 3 out of the 5 scenarios. The differences were largest in the second Car scenario (p &lt; 0.001), the initial Car scenario (p = 0.009), and the Work Zone scenario (p = 0.015). In the second Car scenario (Car_T2), the difference between ratings was 2.1 with Anxious group&#39;s mean confusion was 3.50, while the Non-Anxious group&#39;s was only 1.40.

Unlike the &quot;I Felt Stressed&quot; metric where both groups&#39; ratings dropped in the second Car scenario, the Anxious group&#39;s &quot;I Was Confused&quot; rating remained high and virtually unchanged after the affirmation (Car: 3.69, Car_T2: 3.50). The Non-Anxious group, however, did see a drop in their confusion (Car: 2.07, Car_T2: 1.40). This suggests the positive affirmation did not alleviate the feeling of confusion for the Anxious participants. 

The Pedestrian and Truck scenarios were the only two where there was no statistically significant difference in confusion between the two groups. These scenarios also had the highest confusion ratings for both groups (Anxious: 3.75 &amp; 4.56; Non-Anxious: 3.00 &amp; 3.40), suggesting these events invoke similar confusion level for all participants, regardless of their anxiety group. </code></pre>

<h4>Major observations based on the statistical analysis of the ‘I Felt
Safe’</h4>
<p>(Note: For this question, a higher score (1-9) means “Completely
agree” / felt more safe.)</p>
<pre><code>This is the most conclusive finding across all three survey questions. The difference between the two groups is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) for every single scenario. The Non-Anxious group&#39;s mean safety rating was consistently high (between 7.27 and 8.60), while the Anxious group&#39;s ratings were substantially lower (between 5.38 and 6.69).

Unlike the &quot;confusion&quot; metrics, the positive affirmation had a positive effect on safety ratings for both groups. The Anxious group&#39;s safety rating rose from 6.31 to 6.69, and the Non-Anxious group&#39;s rating also rose from 8.13 to 8.60. Both groups felt safest in the Car_T2 scenario.

The &quot;Safest&quot; Scenario for the Anxious Group Was Still Worse Than the &quot;Least Safe&quot; for the Non-Anxious Group. To put the gap in perspective, the highest mean safety rating for the Anxious group (6.69 in Car_T2) was still significantly lower than the lowest mean safety rating for the Non-Anxious group (7.27 in Pedestrian). </code></pre>
